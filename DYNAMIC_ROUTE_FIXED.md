# ✅ DYNAMIC ROUTE CONFLICT FIXED!

## 🎯 The Problem

Error: `You cannot use different slug names for the same dynamic path ('id' !== 'courseId').`

**Why it happened:**

- I created `/api/courses/[courseId]/publish/route.ts`
- But you already had `/api/courses/[id]/route.ts`
- Next.js doesn't allow both `[id]` and `[courseId]` in the same path level
- Conflict! 💥

---

## ✅ The Fix

### 1. **Moved publish route to correct location**

```
OLD: src/app/api/courses/[courseId]/publish/route.ts
NEW: src/app/api/courses/[id]/publish/route.ts
```

### 2. **Updated parameter name**

```typescript
// Before:
export async function PATCH(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: { courseId: string } }
) {
  const { courseId } = params;
}

// After:
export async function PATCH(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: { id: string } }
) {
  const { id } = params;
}
```

### 3. **Deleted duplicate folder**

```powershell
Remove-Item "src\app\api\courses\[courseId]" -Recurse -Force
```

### 4. **Cleared Next.js cache**

```powershell
Remove-Item ".next" -Recurse -Force
npm run dev
```

## 🔌 API Endpoint Fixed

**Endpoint:** `PATCH /api/courses/[id]/publish`

**What it does:**

1. Verify user owns the course
2. Update status from "draft" → "published"
3. Set publishedAt timestamp
4. Return published course

**Usage in frontend:**

```typescript
// PDF-to-Course page
const response = await fetch(`/api/courses/${courseData.courseId}/publish`, {
  method: "PATCH",
});
```

---

## ✅ Verified Working

```
✅ [courseId] folder deleted
✅ Publish route moved to [id]/publish/
✅ Parameters updated (id instead of courseId)
✅ Next.js cache cleared
✅ Dev server restarted
✅ No more dynamic route conflicts
```
