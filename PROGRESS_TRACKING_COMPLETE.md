## 🎯 HOW IT WORKS

### User Flow:

1. **Student Enrolls in Course**

   - Clicks "Enroll" button
   - POST `/api/courses/[id]` creates enrollment
   - Redirected to course player

2. **Student Watches Video**

   - VideoPlayer loads last position from API
   - Video resumes at saved position
   - Every 5 seconds: saves progress to database
   - At 95% watched: auto-completes lesson

3. **Lesson Completion**

   - `completed = true` saved to `lesson_progress`
   - Enrollment progress recalculated
   - If all lessons done: `status = 'completed'`

4. **Student Returns to Dashboard**

   - Visits `/my-courses`
   - Sees all enrolled courses with progress
   - Clicks "Continue: [Lesson]" button
   - Jumps to exact lesson + video position

5. **Resume Learning**
   - Video auto-seeks to last position
   - Picks up exactly where left off
   - Progress continues tracking

## 📊 DATABASE UPDATES

### Automatic Updates:

**lesson_progress table:**

```sql
UPDATE lesson_progress SET
  "watchTime" = 145,        -- seconds watched
  "lastPosition" = 145,     -- current video position
  progress = 72.5,          -- percentage complete
  status = 'in_progress',   -- not_started | in_progress | completed
  completed = false,        -- true at 95%
  "lastAccessedAt" = NOW(), -- timestamp
  "updatedAt" = NOW()
WHERE "userId" = 'user_123'
AND "lessonId" = 'lesson_456';
```

**course_enrollments table:**

```sql
UPDATE course_enrollments SET
  progress = 45,              -- overall course progress %
  "completedLessons" = 9,     -- count of completed lessons
  "totalLessons" = 20,        -- total in course
  status = 'active',          -- or 'completed'
  "completedAt" = NULL,       -- set when done
  "lastAccessedAt" = NOW(),   -- timestamp
  "updatedAt" = NOW()
WHERE "userId" = 'user_123'
AND "courseId" = 'course_123';
```
