# 🎉 COURSE ID ISSUE FIXED!

## 🐛 The Root Cause

**API Response Structure Mismatch!**

### What the API Actually Returns:

```typescript
{
  success: true,
  courseId: "course-1234...",  // ← ID is here!
  analysis: {                  // ← Course data is here!
    title: "...",
    description: "...",
    difficulty: "intermediate",
    lessons: [...]
  }
}
```

### What the Frontend Was Looking For:

```typescript
result.course.id; // ❌ WRONG! There's no "course" object
```

**Result:** `undefined` everywhere! 🤦

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Changed Frontend to Match API:

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
courseId: result.course?.id; // ❌ result.course doesn't exist!

// After (FIXED):
courseId: result.courseId; // ✅ Correct!
```

Also updated all the data extraction:

```typescript
// Before:
result.course?.title;
result.course?.description;
result.course?.level;

// After:
result.analysis?.title;
result.analysis?.description;
result.analysis?.difficulty;
```
