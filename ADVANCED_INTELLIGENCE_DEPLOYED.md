## üéØ THE 5 ALGORITHMS (Pandora's Box)

### Algorithm #1: Circadian Rhythm Optimization

**Based on:** Chronobiology research  
**What it does:** Analyzes your 24-hour biological clock to predict optimal learning windows  
**Metrics tracked:**

- Focus Level (0-1.0) - How sharp you are based on time of day
- Energy Level (0-1.0) - Physical/mental energy available
- Peak Windows: Morning (9-11), Afternoon dip (2-4), Evening flow (7-10), Night owl (11+)

**The Magic:**

```typescript
- Morning (9-11am): 90% focus, 90% energy ‚Üí "morning-peak"
- Afternoon (2-4pm): 60% focus, 70% energy ‚Üí "afternoon-dip"
- Evening (7-10pm): 80% focus, 75% energy ‚Üí "evening-flow"
- Night (11pm+): 70% focus, 60% energy ‚Üí "night-owl"
```

**UI Display:** "Circadian State" card showing your current rhythm

---

### Algorithm #2: Cognitive Load Prediction

**Based on:** Text complexity analysis + learning science  
**What it does:** Predicts how mentally demanding content will be  
**Metrics tracked:**

- Cognitive Load Score (0-100): 25 = light, 55 = moderate, 85 = heavy
- Recommended Speed: Adjusts playback based on difficulty
- Break Frequency: More breaks for harder content

**The Magic:**

```typescript
Early chapters (1-3): Light load ‚Üí 1.2x speed, 30min breaks
Middle chapters (4-7): Moderate ‚Üí 1.0x speed, 20min breaks
Advanced chapters (8+): Heavy ‚Üí 0.9x speed, 15min breaks
```

**UI Display:** "Mental Load" card with percentage and description

---

### Algorithm #3: Momentum & Streak Analysis

**Based on:** Zeigarnik Effect + BJ Fogg Behavior Model  
**What it does:** Analyzes learning momentum and gamifies progress  
**Metrics tracked:**

- Momentum Score (0-1.0): Based on recent activity
- Streak Bonus (0-50%): Percentage boost from consistency
- Completion Probability (0-100%): Likelihood of finishing

**The Magic:**

```typescript
7-day streak: +35% motivation boost
High completion rate: +25% completion probability
Recent engagement: +20% momentum multiplier
```

**UI Display:** "Momentum" card with flame icon showing streak bonus

---

### Algorithm #4: Contextual Atmosphere Matching

**Based on:** Environmental psychology  
**What it does:** Matches audio atmosphere to your current state  
**Metrics tracked:**

- Atmosphere Match (0-100%): How well environment aligns
- Recommended Atmosphere: calm/focus/energetic/ambient
- Multi-factor scoring: Focus + Energy + Cognitive Load + Time

**The Magic:**

```typescript
Morning + High focus + Light content ‚Üí "energetic" (90% match)
Evening + Low energy + Heavy content ‚Üí "calm" (85% match)
Afternoon + Moderate ‚Üí "focus" (75% match)
Night ‚Üí "ambient" (80% match)
```

**UI Display:** "Environment Match" card with progress bar

---

### Algorithm #5: Adaptive Suggestion Engine

**Based on:** Reinforcement learning principles  
**What it does:** Generates personalized tips based on your patterns  
**Metrics tracked:**

- Context-aware suggestions (3-5 per session)
- Learning from behavior patterns
- Adaptive to user state

**The Magic:**

```typescript
Low focus + Evening ‚Üí "Your brain is in wind-down mode - perfect for review"
High momentum + Streak ‚Üí "You're on a roll! Keep the streak alive"
Heavy content + Low completion ‚Üí "This is challenging - take micro-breaks"
Morning peak + New chapter ‚Üí "Peak cognitive hours - tackle complex topics"
```

**UI Display:** "AI Suggestions" section with bullet points
