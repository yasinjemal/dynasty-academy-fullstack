## 🎯 **WHAT'S LIVE RIGHT NOW:**

### Backend (100% Production-Ready)

✅ 15-step moderation pipeline  
✅ Auto-approve (confidence ≥92%, WER ≤18%, quality ≥70%)  
✅ Anti-fraud play counting (IP hashing + daily dedup)  
✅ Rate limiting (5 uploads/10min, 30 likes/10min)  
✅ Smart playback resolution (human → TTS cache → generate)  
✅ Like/unlike system with atomic operations  
✅ Quality scoring with ASR validation  
✅ 4 levels of deduplication

### Database (100% Complete)

✅ `community_narrations` (24 fields)  
✅ `narration_likes` (unique constraint)  
✅ `narration_plays` (anti-fraud)  
✅ `narration_flags` (reporting)  
✅ `book_permissions` (per-book control)  
✅ All indexes + foreign keys

### API Endpoints (100% Working)

✅ `POST /api/narrations` - Upload with moderation  
✅ `GET /api/narrations/book/{bookId}/{page}` - Fetch page narrations  
✅ `POST /api/narrations/{id}/like` - Like/unlike toggle  
✅ `POST /api/narrations/{id}/play` - Count unique plays  
✅ `POST /api/narrations/resolve` - Smart audio resolution

### Frontend (100% Integrated)

✅ Recording UI with microphone access  
✅ Upload with full metadata (paragraphText, language, style)  
✅ Moderation status display (auto-approved vs pending)  
✅ Community narrations list with animated player

## 🎮 **HOW TO USE IT:**

### As a Narrator:

```
1. Open any book in the reader
2. Click the 🎙️ Mic button
3. Allow microphone permission
4. Click "Start Recording"
5. Read the page aloud
6. Click "Stop Recording"
7. Click "Upload"
8. Get instant feedback:
   ✅ Auto-approved → Live immediately!
   ⏳ Under review → Live after admin approval
```

### As a Listener:

```
1. Open the Community Panel
2. See all approved narrations for current page
3. Click any narration to play
4. Click ❤️ to like great narrators
5. Plays counted automatically (fraud-protected)
```

## 💎 **WHY THIS IS PRODUCTION-GRADE:**

### 1. **Auto-Approve Intelligence** 🧠

```typescript
Auto-approve if:
- ASR confidence ≥ 92%
- Word Error Rate ≤ 18%
- Audio quality ≥ 70%
- Policy clean ✓
```

### 2. **Anti-Fraud Fortress** 🛡️

```typescript
Deduplication:
- contentHash: SHA256(text + lang + style)
- fileHash: SHA256(audio buffer)
- ipHash: SHA256(IP + UA + day)
- Unique constraints on (narrationId, userId)
```

### 3. **Rate Limiting** ⏱️

```typescript
Limits:
- Uploads: 5 per 10 minutes
- Likes: 30 per 10 minutes
- Redis-ready for distributed systems
```

### 4. **Smart Playback** 🎯

```typescript
Resolution priority:
1. Best human narration (likes → plays → quality)
2. Cached TTS (instant, no cost)
3. Generate TTS (on-demand fallback)
```
