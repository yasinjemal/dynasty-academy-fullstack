## 🎯 Next Steps: Database Integration

All features are **fully functional with mock data**. To connect to real database:

### 1. Add Schemas to Prisma

Copy content from these files into `prisma/schema.prisma`:

- `prisma-quiz-schema.sql`
- `prisma-discussion-schema.sql`
- `prisma-resources-schema.sql`
- `prisma-progress-schema.sql`
- `prisma-reviews-schema.sql`

### 2. Run Migration

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_course_features
npx prisma generate
```

### 3. Replace Mock Data in API Routes

For each feature's API routes, replace mock data with Prisma queries.

Example for Quiz:

```typescript
// In /api/lessons/[lessonId]/quiz/route.ts
const quiz = await prisma.quiz.findUnique({
  where: { lessonId: params.lessonId },
  include: { questions: true },
});
```

### 4. Test End-to-End

- Create real quiz questions in database
- Ask real questions in discussion
- Upload real files for resources
- Track real progress as students watch
- Submit real reviews

## 🚨 Known Limitations (To Fix Later)

1. **Mock Data Only** - Need to integrate with real database
2. **No File Upload UI** - Resources tab shows downloads only (upload is instructor-only, not yet built)
3. **No Real-Time** - Discussion updates require refresh (could add WebSocket)
4. **No Notifications** - When someone answers your question (could add email/push)
5. **No Search** - Can't search discussions yet (could add search bar)

These are **enhancement opportunities** for later sprints!
