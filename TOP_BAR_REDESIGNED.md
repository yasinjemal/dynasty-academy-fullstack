## 🎨 DESIGN FEATURES:

### Glassmorphism Effect:

```css
bg-white/10              /* 10% white background */
backdrop-blur-sm         /* Blur effect */
border border-white/20   /* Subtle border */
```

### Active State (When feature is on):

```css
bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-pink-500  /* Gradient background */
text-white               /* White text */
shadow-lg                /* Drop shadow */
```

### Hover Animation:

```typescript
whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}  // Grows 5%
whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}    // Shrinks 5% when clicked
```

### Responsive Labels:

```tsx
<span className="text-xs font-medium hidden sm:inline">Label</span>
```

## ✨ WHY THIS IS BETTER:

### Before (Icon-Only):

❌ Users confused about what icons do  
❌ No visual feedback when active  
❌ Hard to distinguish features  
❌ Requires guessing or tooltips

### After (Icon + Label):

✅ **Instant clarity** - "Read" means narrator  
✅ **Visual feedback** - Gradient shows it's active  
✅ **Easy to learn** - Short, clear names  
✅ **Professional look** - Modern glassmorphism  
✅ **Responsive** - Works on mobile and desktop

## 🎨 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:

### 1. **Clarity First**

Every button tells you what it does in 1-2 words

### 2. **State Visibility**

Active buttons have vibrant gradients, inactive are subtle glass

### 3. **Smooth Interactions**

Every hover, click, and transition feels polished

### 4. **Consistent Language**

- "Mark" → Bookmark (shorter, clearer)
- "Listen" → Listen mode (action-oriented)
- "Read" → Narrator (what it does)
- "Record" → Record yourself (direct)
- "Community" → Community narrations (social)
- "AI" → AI Study Buddy (tech)
- "Share" → Share quotes (action)
- "Settings" → Reading settings (configuration)

### 5. **Visual Hierarchy**

- **Glass buttons**: Available features
- **Gradient buttons**: Active features
- **Badges/Dots**: Additional info (counts, recording status)
