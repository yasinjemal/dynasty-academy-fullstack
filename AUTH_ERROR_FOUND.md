# 🔒 AUTHENTICATION ERROR FOUND!

## ❌ The Problem

**Error:** `POST /api/courses/pdf-to-course 401 Unauthorized`

**What it means:** You're not signed in!

The PDF-to-Course API requires authentication, but the browser is sending requests without a valid session.

---

## 🔍 Why This Happens

Looking at the logs:

```
GET /api/auth/session 200 in 142ms  ← Session exists
POST /api/courses/pdf-to-course 401 ← But API says unauthorized?
```

Two possible causes:

### 1. **Session Not Being Sent**

The API might not be receiving the session cookie properly.

### 2. **User Not Found in Database**

Session exists, but the user email doesn't match anyone in the database.

---

## ✅ Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Sign In (Easiest!)

```
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Sign In"
3. Sign in with your account
4. Go back to: http://localhost:3000/pdf-to-course
5. Upload PDF
```

### Option 2: Check Your Session

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
fetch("/api/auth/session")
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then(console.log);
```

Should show:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "email": "your@email.com",
    "name": "Your Name",
    "id": "..."
  }
}
```

If it shows `{}` - you're not signed in!

## 🔧 What I Fixed

### 1. **Better Error Messages**

```typescript
// Before:
if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error("Failed to generate course");
}

// After:
if (!response.ok) {
  const errorData = await response
    .json()
    .catch(() => ({ error: "Unknown error" }));
  console.error("API Error:", errorData);
  throw new Error(
    errorData.error || `Failed to generate course (${response.status})`
  );
}
```

Now you'll see the actual error:

- "Unauthorized" (401)
- "User not found" (404)
- Actual error message from API

### 2. **Better Error Display**

```typescript
// Before:
alert("Failed to generate course. Please try again.");

// After:
const errorMessage =
  error instanceof Error
    ? error.message
    : "Failed to generate course. Please try again.";
alert(errorMessage);
```

Now the alert will show the real problem!

## 🧪 Test It Now

### Step 1: Make Sure You're Signed In

```
1. Open: http://localhost:3000
2. Check top-right corner
3. If you see "Sign In" button → Click it and sign in
4. If you see your name/avatar → You're good!
```

### Step 2: Try PDF Upload Again

```
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/pdf-to-course
2. Upload a PDF
3. Click "Generate Course"
```

### Step 3: Check the Error Message

If it still fails, the alert will now tell you WHY:

- "Unauthorized" → Sign in first
- "User not found" → Your email isn't in the database
- Other error → Check browser console for details

---

## 🎯 Most Likely Solution

**You just need to sign in!**

The PDF-to-Course API needs to know WHO is creating the course (to set the `authorId`).

```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Sign in with your account
3. Return to /pdf-to-course
4. Upload PDF
5. Should work! ✅
```

---

## 🔍 Debug Checklist

If signing in doesn't work:

### 1. Check Session

```javascript
// Browser console:
fetch("/api/auth/session")
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then(console.log);
```

### 2. Check Database

```sql
-- Make sure your user exists:
SELECT id, email, name FROM "User" WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

### 3. Check API Logs

Look in terminal for:

```
POST /api/courses/pdf-to-course 401
```

Should show the actual error message.
