### Step 3: Enable Certificates (if needed) 🔧

If the card says "Certificates not available", run:

```powershell
node -e "const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client'); const p = new PrismaClient(); (async () => { await p.$executeRaw`UPDATE courses SET \"certificateEnabled\" = true WHERE id = '4a244b5f-e694-413b-b6f3-1921ece7cb77'`; console.log('✅ Certificates enabled!'); await p.$disconnect(); })();"
```

---

### Step 4: Set to 100% Complete (if needed) 📊

Check your current progress on the course page. If not 100%, run:

```powershell
# Replace YOUR-USER-ID with your actual user ID (check browser session)
node -e "const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client'); const p = new PrismaClient(); (async () => { await p.$executeRaw`UPDATE course_enrollments SET progress = 100, status = 'completed', \"completedAt\" = NOW(), \"completedLessons\" = \"totalLessons\" WHERE \"courseId\" = '4a244b5f-e694-413b-b6f3-1921ece7cb77' AND \"userId\" = 'YOUR-USER-ID'`; console.log('✅ Course completed!'); await p.$disconnect(); })();"
```

**To find your user ID:**

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run: `fetch('/api/auth/session').then(r => r.json()).then(d => console.log('User ID:', d.user.id))`

   - Creates unique verification code
   - Generates PDF
   - Stores in database
   - Returns certificate data
4. Success! Card updates with certificate info

### Step 6: Download PDF 📄

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Don't see CertificateCard on course page

**Solution:** Hard refresh the page (Ctrl + F5 or Cmd + Shift + R)

The component was just integrated and Next.js might be caching the old version.

---

### Issue: "Not enrolled in this course"

**Solution:** Enroll in the course first!

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/courses
2. Click on the course
3. Click "Enroll" button

---

### Issue: API returns 401 Unauthorized

**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in!

1. Visit: http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Sign In"
3. Login with Google OAuth

---

### Issue: PDF doesn't generate

**Check browser console (F12) for errors:**

- Look for red error messages
- Check Network tab for failed requests
- Look at `/api/courses/[id]/certificate` response

**Check server terminal for errors:**

- jsPDF errors
- Database errors
- Prisma query failures

---

## 📊 VERIFY IN DATABASE

### Check if certificate was created:

```sql
SELECT
  c.id,
  c."verificationCode",
  c."issuedAt",
  u.name as "userName",
  co.title as "courseTitle"
FROM certificates c
JOIN users u ON u.id = c."userId"
JOIN courses co ON co.id = c."courseId"
ORDER BY c."issuedAt" DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Check enrollment status:

```sql
SELECT
  u.name,
  ce.progress,
  ce.status,
  ce."completedAt",
  ce."certificateIssued",
  ce."certificateUrl"
FROM course_enrollments ce
JOIN users u ON u.id = ce."userId"
WHERE ce."courseId" = '4a244b5f-e694-413b-b6f3-1921ece7cb77';
```
