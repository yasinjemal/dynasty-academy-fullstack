## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
npm install pdf-parse
npm install openai
```

### Step 2: Set Up OpenAI (for real AI)

```typescript
// lib/openai.ts
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

export async function analyzePDF(text: string) {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a course creation expert...",
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: `Create a course from this content:\n\n${text}`,
      },
    ],
  });

  return JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content);
}
```

### Step 3: Update API Route

```typescript
// In route.ts, replace simulateAIAnalysis with:
import { analyzePDF } from "@/lib/openai";
import pdf from "pdf-parse";

const pdfData = await pdf(buffer);
const analysis = await analyzePDF(pdfData.text);
```

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables

```bash
# .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```
