# 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE - Book Import System

## ⚡ **GET STARTED IN 3 MINUTES!**

## ✅ **Step 1: Update Database Schema**

The new book fields need to be added to your database:

npx prisma db push
```

**What this does**:

- Adds `bookType`, `source`, `externalId` fields to Book table
- Adds `language`, `isbn`, `publisher`, `publicationYear` fields
- Creates indexes for performance
- **Does NOT** delete existing data! ✅

**Expected output**:

```
✔ Generated Prisma Client
✔ Your database is now in sync with your Prisma schema
```
