5. **You'll have 10 fully readable free books!**

Then repeat for:

- Philosophy (10 books)
- History (10 books)
- Science (10 books)
- Adventure (10 books)

**Total: 50 amazing free books in 30 minutes!**

## 💡 **PRO TIPS**

**Gutenberg vs Open Library:**

- **Gutenberg:** More reliable for full text, better formatting
- **Open Library:** Larger catalog, but not all books have full text

**Best categories for Gutenberg:**

- Fiction (Pride and Prejudice, Moby Dick, etc.)
- Philosophy (Plato, Aristotle, Kant)
- Adventure (Treasure Island, Journey to the Center of the Earth)
- Science (Darwin, Einstein papers)

**Import strategy:**

1. Start with popular classics (SEO gold)
2. Focus on Gutenberg for reliability
3. Import 10-20 at a time
4. Review quality before scaling to 100+
