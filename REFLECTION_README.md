## 💡 Best Practices

### Writing Great Reflections

✅ **DO:**
- Write authentically about what you learned
- Include specific examples or quotes
- Explain how you'll apply the knowledge
- Ask questions to spark discussion (if sharing)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Just summarize the chapter
- Write one-liners (min 10 characters)
- Copy-paste content from the book
- Share sensitive personal information publicly

### Privacy Guidelines

🔒 **Keep Private:**
- Personal experiences or struggles
- Work-related confidential information
- Unfinished thoughts or drafts

🌍 **Share Publicly:**
- General insights and learnings
- Questions for the community
- Tips and recommendations
- Discussion-worthy perspectives

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track how reflections drive engagement:

- **Personal Growth:** Number of reflections per user
- **Community Engagement:** Public vs private ratio
- **Discussion Quality:** Comments on reflection-based topics
