## 📊 Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: Daily Automated Interventions

Create a cron job (use Vercel Cron or similar):

```typescript
// src/app/api/cron/daily-engagement/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  const response = await fetch(
    `${process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL}/api/engagement/interventions`,
    {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ threshold: 60 }),
    }
  );

  return Response.json(await response.json());
}
```

Schedule in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/daily-engagement",
      "schedule": "0 9 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Scenario 2: Streak Reminder (Every Evening)

```typescript
// src/app/api/cron/streak-reminders/route.ts
import { scheduleStreakReminders } from "@/lib/engagement/notifications";

export async function GET() {
  await scheduleStreakReminders();
  return Response.json({ success: true });
}
```

Schedule for 8 PM daily:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {

      "schedule": "0 20 * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Scenario 3: Recalculate Engagement Scores (Weekly)

```typescript
// src/app/api/cron/weekly-scores/route.ts

  // Recalculate all engagement scores
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
    where: { role: "USER" },
  });

  for (const user of users) {
    await fetch(`${process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL}/api/engagement/calculate`, {
      method: "POST",

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending?

1. Check SendGrid API key is correct
2. Verify sender email is verified in SendGrid
3. Check SendGrid dashboard > Activity for delivery logs
4. Look for console logs: "✅ [EMAIL] Sent to..."

### Push Notifications Not Working?

1. Currently storing in database only (in-app)
2. To enable web push: integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging
3. To enable mobile push: integrate OneSignal or similar
4. Check browser console for notification permissions

### Student Dashboard Not Loading?

1. Check if user has engagement data: `/api/engagement/xp`
2. Ensure streak record exists (auto-created on first access)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify session is active

### TypeScript Errors?

1. Run `npx prisma generate` to regenerate Prisma client
2. Restart VS Code TypeScript server
3. Clear `.next` folder: `rm -rf .next`
4. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
