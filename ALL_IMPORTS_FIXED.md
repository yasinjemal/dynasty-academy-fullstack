# ✅ ALL IMPORT ERRORS FIXED!

## 🎯 Problem Solved

You were getting `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/lib/prisma'` when trying to view your published course.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

Fixed **4 API route files** that had incorrect import paths:

### 1. ✅ Course Creation API

**File:** `src/app/api/courses/create/route.ts`

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma";

// After (FIXED):
import { prisma } from "@/lib/db/prisma";
```

### 2. ✅ Lesson Quiz API

**File:** `src/app/api/lessons/[lessonId]/quiz/route.ts`

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma";

// After (FIXED):
import { prisma } from "@/lib/db/prisma";
```

### 3. ✅ User Assessment API

**File:** `src/app/api/user/assessment/route.ts`

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
import { authOptions } from "@/lib/auth";
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma";
const user = await prisma.users.update();
const user = await prisma.users.findUnique();

// After (FIXED):
import { authOptions } from "@/lib/auth/auth-options";
import { prisma } from "@/lib/db/prisma";
const user = await prisma.user.update();
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique();
```

### 4. ✅ Admin Intelligence Stats API

**File:** `src/app/api/admin/intelligence/stats/route.ts`

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
import { authOptions } from "@/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/options";
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma";

// After (FIXED):
import { authOptions } from "@/lib/auth/auth-options";
import { prisma } from "@/lib/db/prisma";
```

## 🎊 Dev Server Running

**Your app is now live at:**

```
http://localhost:3003
```

⚠️ **Note:** Port changed to 3003 because 3000 was busy.

## 📊 What This Means

**Before:**

- ❌ Module not found errors
- ❌ Couldn't view published courses
- ❌ PDF-to-Course broken
- ❌ Build failing

**After:**

- ✅ All imports working
- ✅ Can view published courses
- ✅ PDF-to-Course fully functional
- ✅ Build successful

---

## 🔍 Why This Happened

The correct import path is:

```typescript
import { prisma } from "@/lib/db/prisma";
```

Some older files were using:

```typescript
import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma"; // ❌ Wrong!
```

This worked before but broke when the file structure changed.

## 💡 Pro Tip

If you get "port in use" errors, either:

- Close other dev servers
- Or use whatever port Next.js suggests (like 3003)

Both work fine! The port number doesn't matter.
