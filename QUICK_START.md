## 📊 What's Happening Under the Hood

### **Every Frame (60fps):**

```
1. Render 2000 particles with physics
2. Update particle positions (spiral motion)
3. Calculate page curl angles
4. Apply lerp interpolation
5. Run post-processing (Bloom + DoF)
6. Update camera position
7. Render shadows (2048×2048)
8. Draw everything to canvas
```

### **On Page Turn:**

```
1. GSAP timeline starts
2. Page rotates 180° over 0.8s
3. Power2.easeInOut curve applied
4. Animation lock prevents spam
5. State updates on complete
6. Content loads for next spread
```

### **On Environment Switch:**

```
1. Environment component unmounts
2. New environment mounts
3. Lights change color/intensity
4. Fog settings update
5. Background elements swap
6. Smooth transition (no flicker)
```
