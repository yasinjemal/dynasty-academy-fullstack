3. Database connection is working
4. Try again (sometimes network hiccup)

### "Can't see published course"

**Check**:

1. Status is "Published" not "Draft"

**Fix**: Generate quizzes at `/admin/quiz-generator` first

## Pro Tips

### 🎯 Tip 1: Test with Draft First

Always publish as **Draft** first:

Before publishing, ensure you have:

- ✅ Generated course (Phase 2a)

- Paid courses
- Skill-building courses

Students LOVE certificates! 🏆

### 🎯 Tip 4: Start Free

First few courses should be **free**:

- High quality content
- Strong reviews (after launch)
