### Economic Impact:

**Traditional TTS:**

- 1,000 users × 10 chapters × $0.60 = $6,000/month
- Cost per user: $6.00/month
- Not scalable, not profitable

**Dynasty Smart Caching:**

- 1,000 users × 10 chapters × 5% × $0.60 = $300/month
- Cost per user: $0.30/month
- **Savings: $5,700/month (95%)**

**ROI:**

- Year 1: $84K revenue, $73.4K profit
- Year 2: $360K revenue, $317K profit
- Year 3: $1.8M revenue, $1.635M profit
