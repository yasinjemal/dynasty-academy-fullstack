# 🎓 Course Progression System - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview

The complete course progression system has been implemented! This system ensures that students must complete lessons and pass quizzes before moving forward, eliminating the ability to skip content or get certificates without actually studying.

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema** ✅

All database tables have been updated with progression tracking:

**`lesson_progress` table:**

- `quiz_passed` (boolean) - Whether the student passed the quiz
- `quiz_attempts` (integer) - Number of quiz attempts
- `last_quiz_score` (float) - Most recent quiz score
- `can_proceed` (boolean) - Whether student can move to next lesson

**`course_lessons` table:**

- `is_locked` (boolean, default: true) - Lesson lock status
- `requires_quiz` (boolean, default: true) - Whether quiz is required
- `prerequisite_lesson_id` (uuid) - Previous lesson requirement

**`quiz_attempts` table:**

- `lesson_id` (uuid) - Links attempt to specific lesson
- `course_id` (uuid) - Links attempt to course
- `attempt_number` (integer) - Sequential attempt tracking

### 2. **Backend API Endpoints** ✅

#### **Quiz Submit Endpoint** (`/api/lessons/[lessonId]/quiz/submit`)

**What it does:**

- ✅ Counts previous attempts and enforces max attempt limits
- ✅ Calculates quiz score and determines pass/fail
- ✅ Saves complete attempt record with all answers
- ✅ Updates `lesson_progress` with quiz results
- ✅ Unlocks next lesson if quiz is passed
- ✅ Updates course enrollment progress percentage
- ✅ Returns detailed attempt information

**Response format:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "score": 85,
  "passed": true,
  "correctAnswers": 17,
  "totalQuestions": 20,
  "passingScore": 70,
  "attemptNumber": 1,
  "maxAttempts": 3,
  "message": "🎉 Congratulations! You passed!"
}
```

#### **Course Data Endpoint** (`/api/courses/[id]`)

**What it returns:**

- ✅ Lock status for each lesson (`isLocked`)
- ✅ Quiz requirement status (`requiresQuiz`)
- ✅ Quiz pass status (`quizPassed`)
- ✅ Number of quiz attempts (`quizAttempts`)
- ✅ Last quiz score (`lastQuizScore`)
- ✅ Whether lesson has a quiz (`hasQuiz`)

**SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  l.id, l."sectionId", l.title, l.type,
  l."isLocked", l."requiresQuiz",
  COALESCE(lp."quizPassed", false) as "quizPassed",
  COALESCE(lp."quizAttempts", 0) as "quizAttempts",
  lp."lastQuizScore" as "lastQuizScore",
  (SELECT COUNT(*) > 0 FROM course_quizzes WHERE "lessonId" = l.id) as "hasQuiz"
FROM course_lessons l
LEFT JOIN lesson_progress lp ON lp."lessonId" = l.id AND lp."userId" = ?
WHERE l."courseId" = ?
ORDER BY l."order" ASC
```

#### **Certificate Endpoint** (`/api/courses/[id]/certificate`)

**New validation:**

- ✅ Checks course completion (100% progress)
- ✅ **NEW:** Verifies ALL required quizzes are passed
- ✅ Returns detailed error if quizzes incomplete

**Validation query:**

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE l."requiresQuiz" = true) as "totalRequiredQuizzes",
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE l."requiresQuiz" = true AND lp."quizPassed" = true) as "passedQuizzes"
FROM course_lessons l
LEFT JOIN lesson_progress lp ON lp."lessonId" = l.id AND lp."userId" = ?
WHERE l."courseId" = ?
```

**Error response if quizzes not complete:**

```json
{
  "error": "All required quizzes must be passed to generate certificate",
  "totalRequiredQuizzes": 10,
  "passedQuizzes": 7,
  "remainingQuizzes": 3
}
```

### 3. **Frontend Course Page** ✅

#### **Updated Lesson Interface**

```typescript
interface Lesson {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  type: "video" | "pdf" | "article" | "quiz";
  duration: number;
  completed: boolean;
  // 🔒 New progression fields:
  isLocked?: boolean;
  requiresQuiz?: boolean;
  quizPassed?: boolean;
  quizAttempts?: number;
  lastQuizScore?: number;
  hasQuiz?: boolean;
}
```

#### **Navigation Logic Updates**

**`completeLesson()` function:**

- ✅ Checks if quiz is required but not passed
- ✅ Shows alert and switches to quiz tab if quiz needed
- ✅ Only allows completion after quiz is passed

**`goToNextLesson()` function:**

- ✅ If current lesson has quiz and not passed → switch to quiz tab
- ✅ If next lesson is locked → show alert, prevent navigation
- ✅ Auto-switches to overview tab when moving to new lesson

**`handleQuizComplete()` function (NEW):**

- ✅ Refreshes course data when quiz is passed
- ✅ Updates current lesson state with new quiz status
- ✅ Shows success message with score
- ✅ Switches back to overview tab
- ✅ Allows navigation to newly unlocked lesson

#### **Button UI Updates**

**"Next" Button:**

```typescript
{
  currentLesson.hasQuiz && !currentLesson.quizPassed ? (
    <>
      Take Quiz
      <Brain className="w-4 h-4" />
    </>
  ) : (
    <>
      Next
      <ChevronRight className="w-4 h-4" />
    </>
  );
}
```

**"Mark Complete" Button:**

```typescript
disabled={
  currentLesson.completed ||
  (currentLesson.hasQuiz && !currentLesson.quizPassed)
}
title={
  currentLesson.hasQuiz && !currentLesson.quizPassed
    ? "Pass the quiz first to complete this lesson"
    : ""
}
```

- ✅ Shows "Complete Quiz First 🔒" when quiz not passed
- ✅ Disabled until quiz is completed
- ✅ Tooltip explains requirement

#### **Sidebar Lesson List Updates**

**Lock Indicator:**

```typescript
{
  lesson.isLocked && <span className="text-red-400 ml-auto">🔒</span>;
}
```

**Quiz Status Indicator:**

```typescript
{
  lesson.hasQuiz && (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-1 text-xs">
      <Brain className="w-3 h-3" />
      {lesson.quizPassed ? (
        <span className="text-green-400">✓ Passed</span>
      ) : (
        <span className="text-yellow-400">
          {lesson.quizAttempts || 0} attempts
        </span>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Click Protection:**

```typescript
onClick={(e) => {
  if (lesson.isLocked) {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert(`🔒 This lesson is locked. Complete the previous lesson and pass its quiz first!`);
    return;
  }
  setCurrentLesson(lesson);
  setActiveTab("overview");
}}
```

#### **Quiz Component Integration**

```typescript
{
  activeTab === "quiz" && currentLesson && (
    <QuizComponent
      lessonId={currentLesson.id}
      onComplete={handleQuizComplete}
    />
  );
}
```

- ✅ Passes callback to refresh data on quiz pass
- ✅ Shows success message
- ✅ Updates lesson states
- ✅ Unlocks next lesson

### 4. **Progress Calculation** ✅

**Old calculation:**

```
progress = (completed_lessons / total_lessons) * 100
```

**New calculation:**

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE l."requiresQuiz" = true AND lp."quizPassed" = true) as "completedLessons",
  COUNT(*) as "totalLessons"
FROM course_lessons l
LEFT JOIN lesson_progress lp ON lp."lessonId" = l.id AND lp."userId" = ?
WHERE l."courseId" = ?
```

- ✅ Only counts lessons where quiz is passed
- ✅ Updates in real-time when quiz is submitted
- ✅ Accurately reflects actual progress
