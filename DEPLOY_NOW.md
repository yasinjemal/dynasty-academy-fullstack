# 🚀 DEPLOY DYNASTY AUDIO INTELLIGENCE - ONE COMMAND

**Execute the Empire: Deploy Smart Audio This Week**

---

## ⚡ FASTEST PATH (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xepfxnqprkcccgnwmctj/sql
2. Login with your credentials
3. Click **"New Query"**

### Step 2: Copy & Paste Migration Script

1. Open `migrate-smart-audio.sql` in this folder
2. Select ALL content (Ctrl+A)
3. Copy (Ctrl+C)
4. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"** button

### Step 3: Generate Prisma Client

```powershell
cd C:\Users\bpass\dynasty\dynasty-academy-fullstack
npx prisma generate
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Then in browser console at http://localhost:3000:

```javascript
// Test the smart audio system
await fetch("/api/voice", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  credentials: "include",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    text: "The Dynasty Empire begins today.",
    voiceId: "EXAVITQu4vr4xnSDxMaL",
    bookId: "test",
    chapterId: "1",
    quality: "premium",
  }),
})
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then(console.log);
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
{
  "cached": false,
  "audioUrl": "data:audio/mp3;base64,...",
  "costSaved": 0,
  "message": "🔥 Generated new audio! Future requests will be instant."
}
```

**Run again** (exact same request):

```json
{
  "cached": true,
  "audioUrl": "data:audio/mp3;base64,...",
  "costSaved": 0.0198,
  "cacheHitRate": 50.0,
  "message": "🎉 Instant delivery from cache! Saved $0.0198"
}
```

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

After deployment, you should see:

- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Dev server starts successfully
- ✅ First audio request generates (~3 seconds)
- ✅ Second request instant (<1 second)
- ✅ `cached: true` on repeat requests
- ✅ Cache hit rate increases with each test

## 🎯 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

### Week 1: Deploy & Stabilize

- Deploy today
- Test with real book chapters
- Monitor for any errors
- Fix any issues immediately

### Days 1-7: Collect Initial Data

Track in spreadsheet:

- Total requests per day
- Cache hits vs misses
- Hit rate percentage
- Total cost
- Total savings

### Day 7: First Metrics Review

You should see:

- Cache hit rate: 40-60% (early days)
- Cost per user: ~$0.80
- Response time (cached): <200ms
- No critical bugs

### Days 8-30: Optimization Period

- Hit rate should climb to 70-80%
- Cost per user drops to ~$0.40
- User feedback: "audio is instant"
- System stable and reliable

### Day 30: Strategic Decision Point

With real data, choose your path:

- **Option 1:** Full pivot to API business (if metrics are incredible)
- **Option 2:** Hybrid strategy (Academy + API) ← **RECOMMENDED**
- **Option 3:** License to TTS provider (if they approach you)
- **Option 4:** Keep internal only (if you prefer pure focus)

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Migration fails with "column already exists"

**Solution:** Columns already added, skip to Step 3 (Prisma generate)

### Issue: TypeScript errors after migration

**Solution:** This is expected. Run `npx prisma generate` to sync types.

### Issue: "User not authenticated" when testing /api/voice

**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in to Dynasty Academy first at localhost:3000

### Issue: Dev server won't start

**Solution:**

```powershell
# Kill any running node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Clear Next.js cache
rm -r .next

# Restart
npm run dev
```
