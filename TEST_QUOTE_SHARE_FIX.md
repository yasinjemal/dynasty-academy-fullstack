## 🔍 Technical Details

The fix converts Tailwind's `oklch()` colors to RGB format before `html2canvas` processes the DOM. This ensures compatibility without changing visual appearance.

## 💡 Common Issues

### If Download Still Fails

- **Check browser permissions**: Some browsers block auto-downloads
- **Try incognito mode**: Extensions can interfere
- **Check console**: Look for other errors

### If Copy Fails

- **Check clipboard permissions**: Browser needs clipboard access
- **Try paste immediately**: Some apps show paste option after copy

### If Colors Look Different

- **This shouldn't happen** - RGB conversion preserves colors
- **If it does**: Screenshot before/after and report

## 🎉 Success Indicators

- ✅ Image downloads as high-quality PNG (3x resolution)
- ✅ All 60+ templates work flawlessly
- ✅ Colors match preview exactly
- ✅ Gradients render beautifully
- ✅ Text shadows preserved
- ✅ Custom backgrounds work
- ✅ Dynasty watermark included
