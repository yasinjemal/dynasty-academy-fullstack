# 🐛 FIELD NAME MISMATCH FIXED!

## ❌ The Problem

**Error:** "No PDF file provided" (400 Bad Request)

**Why:**

```typescript
// Frontend was sending:
formData.append("file", file); // ❌ Wrong field name

// But API was expecting:
const file = formData.get("pdf") as File; // ✅ Expects "pdf"
```

**Field name mismatch!** The frontend and backend weren't speaking the same language. 🤦

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Changed frontend to match API:

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN):
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("file", file); // ❌

// After (FIXED):
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("pdf", file); // ✅
```

Now both sides are aligned!
