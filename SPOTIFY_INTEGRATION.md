# ðŸŽµ Spotify Integration - Setup Guide

## Overview

The Spotify Integration (#10 in Pandora's Box) allows users to select ANY song from their Spotify playlists as background atmosphere music, with intelligent auto-ducking when the narrator speaks.

## Features

âœ… **OAuth 2.0 Authentication** - Secure Spotify account connection
âœ… **Playlist Browsing** - Browse all user playlists with cover images
âœ… **Web Playback SDK** - Play Spotify tracks directly in the browser
âœ… **Auto-Ducking** - Music volume drops to 15% when narrator speaks, rises to 30% when paused
âœ… **Seamless Integration** - Works perfectly with existing atmosphere system

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Spotify Developer App

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Log in with your Spotify account
3. Click **"Create an App"**
4. Fill in:
   - **App Name**: Dynasty Academy
   - **App Description**: AI-powered book reading platform with Spotify integration
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:3002/api/spotify/callback` (for development)
   - **Redirect URI**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/spotify/callback` (for production)
5. Click **Save**
6. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Add Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Spotify Integration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3002
```

### 3. Test the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open a book and enter Listen Mode
3. Click **"ðŸŽµ Spotify Integration"** in the atmosphere controls
4. Click **"Connect Spotify"**
5. Authorize Dynasty Academy in the popup
6. Browse your playlists
7. Select a playlist â†’ Music starts playing
8. Play the narrator â†’ Music ducks to 15%
9. Pause the narrator â†’ Music rises to 30%

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Connect Spotify"
2. Opens OAuth popup to `accounts.spotify.com/authorize`
3. User authorizes Dynasty Academy
4. Spotify redirects to `/api/spotify/callback`
5. Backend exchanges code for access token
6. Token sent to frontend via `postMessage`
7. Playlists fetched from Spotify API

### Playback Flow

1. Load Spotify Web Playback SDK
2. Initialize player with access token
3. User selects playlist â†’ Transfer playback to our player
4. Play playlist via Spotify Web API
5. Monitor narrator audio element every 200ms
6. Adjust Spotify volume based on narrator state

### Auto-Ducking Logic

```typescript
const setupAutoDucking = () => {
  setInterval(() => {
    const audioElement = document.querySelector("audio");
    if (audioElement && !audioElement.paused) {
      player.setVolume(0.15); // Narrator speaking
    } else {
      player.setVolume(0.3); // Narrator paused
    }
  }, 200);
};
```

## API Endpoints

### `/api/spotify/callback`

**Method**: GET
**Purpose**: Exchange OAuth code for access token
**Flow**:

1. Receive authorization code from Spotify
2. Exchange for access token using client secret
3. Return token to frontend via `postMessage`
4. Close popup window

- Verify device transfer succeeded

## Production Deployment

1. Update redirect URI in Spotify Developer Dashboard
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to production domain
