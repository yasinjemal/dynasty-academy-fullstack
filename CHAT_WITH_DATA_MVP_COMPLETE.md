## 🎯 **HOW IT WORKS:**

### **Flow:**

```
User asks: "Why did I fail that quiz?"
    ↓
Frontend: LearningDataChat.tsx
    ↓
Query IndexedDB: DataQueryService.getLearningContext()
    ↓
Returns: {
  quizRecent: { scores: [60, 55, 70], avg: 62 },
  video: { watchPct: 0.45, pauses: 12, seeks: 8 },
  attention: { avg: 35, byHour: {...} },
  notes: { count: 0, avgLen: 0 },
  weakTopics: ["React Hooks"]
}
    ↓
API: /api/ai/chat-with-data
    ↓
GPT-4o-mini analyzes with system prompt
    ↓
Returns: "You struggled because:
  • Low video engagement (45%) [video]
  • High pauses (12) indicates confusion [video]
  • Low attention (35%) during lesson [attention]
  • No notes taken [notes]

💡 Next action: Rewatch 'React Hooks' section,
   take notes, and try quiz again tomorrow."

## 💬 **EXAMPLE QUESTIONS:**

### **1. "Why did I fail that quiz?"**

**AI Response:**

```
You struggled because:
• Your quiz average is 62% (below 80% threshold) [quiz]
• Video watch percentage was only 45% [video]
• Attention score during lessons was 35% [attention]
• You took 0 notes (successful students average 3+) [notes]

💡 Next action: Rewatch the "React Hooks" section at 7:32,
   take detailed notes, and retry the quiz tomorrow.
```

### **2. "When should I study?"**

**AI Response:**

```
Your best learning times:
• 9 AM: 85% attention (highest) [attention]
• 2 PM: 65% attention (moderate) [attention]
• 7 PM: 30% attention (lowest) [attention]

💡 Next action: Schedule complex topics (like quizzes)
   for 9-11 AM when your focus peaks.
```

### **3. "Will I pass this course?"**

**AI Response:**

```
Current trajectory analysis:
• Quiz average: 62% (passing is 80%) [quiz]
• Video completion: 45% [video]
• Current probability: 55% chance of passing

💡 Next action: Focus on sections 3-5 where
   engagement was lowest. Complete all videos first.
