## 🔥 **WHAT MAKES THIS REVOLUTIONARY:**

### 1. **Auto-Approve Magic** ✨

High-quality narrations go live **instantly**:

- ASR confidence ≥ 92%
- Word Error Rate ≤ 18%
- Audio quality score ≥ 70%
- No policy violations

### 2. **Anti-Fraud at Every Level** 🛡️

- **IP Hashing**: SHA256(IP + UserAgent + day) prevents play spam
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 uploads/10min, 30 likes/10min
- **Deduplication**: 4 levels (content, file, play, like)
- **Unique Constraints**: One like per user, one play per user/IP/day

### 3. **Smart Playback Resolution** 🧠

Finds the best audio source:

1. **Human narration** (community-powered, best quality)
2. **Cached TTS** (already generated, instant)
3. **Generate TTS** (on-demand, fallback)

### 4. **Community Curation** 👥

Best narrations rise naturally:

- Sort by: likes → plays → quality → date
- Users discover quality through engagement
- No central control, pure democracy
