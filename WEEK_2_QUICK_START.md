## 🔧 API Usage

### Extract Concepts
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/concepts/extract', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ mode: 'all' })
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(`Extracted ${data.totalConcepts} concepts`);
console.log(`Cost: $${data.totalCost.toFixed(4)}`);
```

### Get Statistics
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/concepts/extract');
const data = await response.json();

console.log('Total Concepts:', data.stats.totalConcepts);
console.log('Total Relationships:', data.stats.totalRelationships);
console.log('Categories:', Object.keys(data.stats.byCategory));
```

### Run Tests
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/concepts/test', {
  method: 'POST'
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log('Overall Accuracy:', (data.overallAccuracy * 100).toFixed(1) + '%');
console.log('Status:', data.passedAllTests ? '✅ PASSED' : '❌ FAILED');
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No concepts found"
- Run concept extraction first
- Check if courses are published
- Verify OpenAI API key is set

### "Tests show low accuracy"
- Need at least 10+ concepts
- Run extraction on more courses
- Check HNSW index is created

### "Extraction taking too long"
- Normal for 100+ courses (6-8 minutes)
- GPT-4 rate limits apply
- Check terminal for progress logs

### "Cost is high"
- ~$0.05-0.15 per course is normal
- Use caching to reduce embedding costs
- Consider extracting selectively
