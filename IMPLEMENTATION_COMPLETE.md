## 📋 Next Steps (Setup Required)

### 1. Get Stripe API Keys

```bash
# Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
# Copy your keys:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 2. Add to `.env`

```env
# Add these lines to your .env file:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=(get this next)
```

### 3. Test Webhooks Locally

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
npm install -g stripe

# Login
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

This command will output a webhook secret like:
```
> Ready! Your webhook signing secret is whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Copy that and add to your `.env`:
```env
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 4. Create Products in Stripe Dashboard

Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products

**Book Product:**
- Name: Individual Book
- Price: R265 (or whatever you want)
- One-time payment

**Subscription Products:**
- Basic: R99/month
- Pro: R299/month
- Premium: R499/month
