# 🔥 INTRO PLAYS EVERY TIME NOW!

## ✅ What Changed

**REMOVED localStorage checks** - The intro will now play **EVERY SINGLE TIME** you visit the homepage!

---

## 🎬 Before (One-Time):

```typescript
// ❌ Checked localStorage
const hasSeenIntro = localStorage.getItem("hasSeenIntro");
if (hasSeenIntro === "true") {
  // Skip intro on repeat visits
}

// ❌ Saved to localStorage after viewing
localStorage.setItem("hasSeenIntro", "true");
```

**Result:** Intro only played once, then skipped forever (boring!)

---

## 🔥 After (Every Time):

```typescript
// ✅ NO localStorage check!
// Just plays the intro every time

// ✅ NO saving after viewing
// Fresh experience every visit!
```

**Result:** Intro plays **EVERY TIME** you refresh or visit! 🎉
