JOIN "User" u ON al."actorUserId" = u."id"
ORDER BY al."createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Test 5: Ranking Algorithm Transparency

**Steps:**

1. Open `src/lib/governance/ranking.ts`
2. Review the ranking formula:

   ```
   Score = (Quality * 0.4) + (Engagement * 0.3) + (Accessibility * 0.2) + (Freshness * 0.1)
   ```

3. Test the `explainRanking()` function:
   - Open Node.js REPL or create a test file
   - Import the function
   - Call it with sample metrics

**Example Test:**

```typescript
import {
  calculateCourseRanking,
  explainRanking,
} from "@/lib/governance/ranking";

const sampleMetrics = {
  averageRating: 4.5,
  totalRatings: 50,
  completionRate: 75,
  enrollmentCount: 100,
  activeStudents: 40,
  discussionActivity: 0.6,
  isFree: true,
  hasClosedCaptions: true,
  multilingualSupport: false,
  publishedAt: new Date("2024-01-01"),
  lastUpdatedAt: new Date(),
  instructorExperience: 12,
  instructorCourseCount: 2,
};

const ranking = calculateCourseRanking(sampleMetrics);
console.log(explainRanking(ranking));
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Final Score: 78.35/100

Quality: 82.5/100 (40% weight)
Engagement: 76.2/100 (30% weight)
Accessibility: 75.0/100 (20% weight)
Freshness: 100.0/100 (10% weight)
```

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ Algorithm weights are transparent (no hidden factors)
- ‚úÖ Explanation shows breakdown by category
- ‚úÖ New instructors get boost (freshness score)

### Test 6: View Personalized Dashboard

**Steps:**

1. Login as a regular user (not admin)

      "courseId": "...",
      "score": 85.5,
      "reasons": [
        "Matches your interest in Web Development, AI",
        "Popular with similar learners",
        "Recently updated content"
      ],
      "course": {
        "id": "...",
        "title": "Advanced Next.js Development",

### Test 8: Recommendation Engine Accuracy

**Steps:**

1. Enroll in a course (e.g., "Web Development Basics")
2. Complete 50% of the course
3. Wait a few minutes (or clear cache)
4. Refresh dashboard

**Expected Results:**

- ‚úÖ "Continue Learning" shows partially completed course
- ‚úÖ "Recommended for You" shows related courses:
  - Similar topics (e.g., more web development courses)
  - Appropriate difficulty (if beginner course ‚Üí more beginner/intermediate courses)
  - High engagement (popular courses prioritized)

**Verify Scoring:**

- Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
- Reload dashboard
- Find `/api/recommendations` request
- Check response for `score` values (should be 0-100)
- Higher scores = better match

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Unauthorized" error

**Cause**: Not logged in or session expired.  
**Solution**: Logout and login again.

### Issue 2: Recommendations section empty

**Cause**: No courses in database OR user has enrolled in all courses.  
**Solution**:

- Seed database with sample courses
- Create test accounts with different enrollment histories

### Issue 3: Audit logs not appearing

**Cause**: Actions performed before migration.  
**Solution**: Perform new actions (approve/reject applications) after migration.

### Issue 4: Application form disabled

**Cause**: Already have pending/approved application.  
**Solution**:

- Check status at bottom of `/become-instructor` page
- If testing, delete application from database:
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM "InstructorApplication" WHERE "userId" = '<your-user-id>';
  ```
