# 🔥 MODULE 3: ENGAGEMENT DOMINATION SYSTEM - IN PROGRESS

## 🎯 THE VISION

**Build the most powerful student engagement & retention system in EdTech - something that doesn't exist anywhere else!**

This system will:

- **Predict drop-offs BEFORE they happen** (AI-powered churn prediction)
- **Auto-intervene to save students** (smart notifications & personalized content)
- **Make learning ADDICTIVE** (gamification with psychological triggers)
- **Personalize everything** (adapt to each student's learning style & preferences)

## ✅ WHAT WE'VE BUILT (Last 20 Minutes)

### 1. **Database Schema** ✅ COMPLETE

Created 4 powerful new models:

#### **EngagementScore** Model

- AI-predicted drop-off risk scores (0-100)
- Weekly & monthly churn predictions
- Behavioral signals tracking (login frequency, session duration, etc.)
- Intervention tracking (what we tried, did it work?)
- 50+ data points per user

#### **Streak** Model

- Daily activity streaks (like Duolingo)
- Longest streak records
- Streak freeze system (shield your streak!)
- Milestone tracking (7, 14, 30, 100, 365 days)

####**PersonalizationProfile** Model

- Learning style detection (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- Optimal study time calculation
- Preferred pace & difficulty
- Content format preferences
- Motivation triggers (competition, achievement, social)

#### **BehaviorEvent** Model

- Track EVERYTHING users do
- Session tracking
- Device/platform analytics
- ML training data collection

**Status**: ✅ Schema created, Prisma client generated

### 2. **AI Prediction Engine** ✅ COMPLETE

Created `/src/lib/engagement/prediction.ts`:

#### **Core Features:**

- `calculateEngagementScore()` - Main AI prediction function
- Analyzes 15+ behavioral signals
- Weighted risk calculation (can be replaced with real ML model)
- Confidence scoring based on data completeness
- Intervention recommendations

#### **Risk Factors Analyzed:**

1. **Login Behavior** (25% weight)

   - Login frequency
   - Days since last login
   - Login trend (increasing/decreasing)

2. **Session Engagement** (20% weight)

   - Average session duration
   - Session trend
   - Time on platform

3. **Progress Velocity** (20% weight)

   - Lessons completed per week
   - Completion rate
   - Progress trend

4. **Completion Metrics** (15% weight)

   - Overall completion percentage
   - Course progress

5. **Streak & Consistency** (10% weight)

   - Current streak days
   - Streak broken recently?
   - Study consistency

6. **Quiz Performance** (10% weight)
   - Average quiz scores
   - Score trend (improving/declining)

#### **Intervention Recommendations:**

- **Critical Risk (80-100%)**: Human outreach + discount offer
- **High Risk (60-80%)**: Personalized content + streak warnings
- **Medium Risk (40-60%)**: Achievement notifications + peer comparisons
- **Low Risk (20-40%)**: Gentle reminders + milestone celebrations

**Status**: ✅ Complete & ready to use!
