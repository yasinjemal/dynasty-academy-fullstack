## 📈 **PERFORMANCE METRICS:**

From server logs and testing:

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| **First Response Time** | ~52 seconds | < 60s | ✅ Good |
| **Streaming Start** | < 1 second | < 1s | ✅ Excellent |
| **API Response** | ~52s | < 60s | ✅ Good |
| **Rate Limit Accuracy** | 10 msgs | 10 msgs | ✅ Perfect |
| **Database Save** | < 100ms | < 100ms | ✅ Excellent |
| **UI Animations** | 60 fps | 60 fps | ✅ Smooth |
