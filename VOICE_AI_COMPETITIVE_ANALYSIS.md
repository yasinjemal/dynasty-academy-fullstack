## üìä Competitive Moat Analysis

### How Hard Is This to Copy?

| Component               | Difficulty          | Time to Replicate | Competitive Advantage Duration        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Voice Recognition**   | Medium              | 2-3 weeks         | 6 months (not unique tech)            |
| **GPT-4 Integration**   | Easy                | 1 week            | 3 months (anyone can do)              |
