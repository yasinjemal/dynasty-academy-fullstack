## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Stripe Errors

**Error:** `Neither apiKey nor config.authenticator provided`
**Solution:** Add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY to .env file

**Error:** `No such payment_intent`
**Solution:** Webhook secret incorrect, run `stripe listen` again

**Error:** `Invalid request: customer`
**Solution:** User not found, check session.user.id

### ElevenLabs Errors

**Error:** `401 Unauthorized`
**Solution:** Check ELEVENLABS_API_KEY in .env

**Error:** `Quota exceeded`
**Solution:** Upgrade plan or wait for monthly reset

**Error:** `Audio not generating`
**Solution:** Check browser console, verify API key, check network tab

### Database Errors

**Error:** `Can't reach database server`
**Solution:** Check DATABASE_URL, verify Supabase is running

**Error:** `Table 'book_audio' doesn't exist`
**Solution:** Run `node create-audio-table.mjs` again

**Error:** `Prisma Client is not generated`
**Solution:** Run `npx prisma generate`

### Audio Player Issues

**Problem:** Audio doesn't autoplay
**Solution:** Browser autoplay policy, user must click play button first

**Problem:** Audio generates slowly
**Solution:** Normal for first generation (3-5 seconds), cached afterward

**Problem:** Volume slider doesn't work
**Solution:** Check browser volume not muted, reload page
