## 🚀 HOW TO USE

### 1. Blackhole Portal (Homepage Intro)

Replace the current intro in `src/app/page.tsx`:

```tsx
import BlackholePortal from "@/components/intro/BlackholePortal";

export default function Home() {
  const [showIntro, setShowIntro] = useState(true);

  return (
    <>
      {showIntro && <BlackholePortal onComplete={() => setShowIntro(false)} />}

```

### 2. AI Avatar Mentor (Any Page)

Add to course pages, lesson pages, or dashboard:

// In your component
<AIAvatarMentor context="course" courseId={courseId} minimizable={true} />;
```

### 3. Holographic Dashboard (Courses Page)

Replace your courses page:

```tsx
import HolographicDashboard from "@/components/courses/HolographicDashboard";

export default function CoursesPage() {
  return <HolographicDashboard />;
}
```

Or create a new route:

## 🎨 CUSTOMIZATION

### Colors

All three components use your Dynasty Academy color scheme:

- Blue: `#3B82F6`
- Cyan: `#06B6D4`
- Pink: `#ec4899`
- Orange: `#f59e0b`

### Animations

Adjust animation speeds in each component:

```typescript
// Blackhole Portal - line ~140
setTimeout(() => setStage(1), 2000); // Change delay

// AI Avatar - line ~35
meshRef.current.position.y = Math.sin(clock.getElapsedTime() * 0.5) * 0.1;
// Change 0.5 for speed, 0.1 for intensity

// Holographic Dashboard - line ~55
meshRef.current.position.y =
  position[1] + Math.sin(clock.getElapsedTime() + position[0]) * 0.1;
// Change 0.1 for float intensity
```
