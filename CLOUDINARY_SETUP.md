## Cloudinary Features We Use

### 1. **Automatic Transformations**
```javascript
{
  transformation: [
    { width: 400, height: 400, crop: 'fill', gravity: 'face' },
    { quality: 'auto', fetch_format: 'auto' }
  ]
}
```
- Resizes to 400x400px
- Centers on face (if detected)
- Automatic quality optimization
- Automatic format selection (WebP for modern browsers)

### 2. **Organized Storage**
```
dynasty-academy/
â”œâ”€â”€ avatars/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ avatar_user123_1234567890.jpg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ avatar_user456_1234567891.png
â””â”€â”€ banners/
    â”œâ”€â”€ banner_user123_1234567892.jpg
    â””â”€â”€ banner_user456_1234567893.png
```

### 3. **CDN Delivery**
- Images served from global CDN
- Fast loading worldwide
- Automatic caching

---

## Free Tier Limits

**Cloudinary Free Plan:**
- âœ… 25 credits/month (each transformation = 1 credit)
- âœ… 25GB storage
- âœ… 25GB bandwidth/month
- âœ… Unlimited transformations (charged per credit)
- âœ… Global CDN delivery

**Estimated usage for small app:**
- 100 avatar uploads/month = ~3-5 credits
- 1000 image views = ~0 credits (cached)
- Free tier is MORE than enough for development + small production

---

## Alternative (If you prefer not to use Cloudinary)

### Option 1: Local Storage
Store images in `public/uploads/avatars/`:
```typescript
// Save file locally
const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'public/uploads/avatars', filename)
await fs.writeFile(filePath, buffer)
```
**Pros:** Free, simple
**Cons:** No CDN, no optimization, files in Git

### Option 2: Vercel Blob Storage
```bash
npm install @vercel/blob
```
**Pros:** Integrated with Vercel, auto CDN
**Cons:** Paid only, 5GB = $10/month

### Option 3: AWS S3
**Pros:** Industry standard, very cheap ($0.023/GB)
**Cons:** Complex setup, requires AWS account

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Missing Cloudinary credentials"
- Check `.env` file has all 3 variables
- Restart dev server after adding env vars
- Don't wrap values in extra quotes

### Error: "Upload failed"
- Check API key/secret are correct
- Verify cloud name matches dashboard
- Check file size (max 2MB for avatars)

### Images not loading
- Check Cloudinary dashboard â†’ Media Library
- Verify `secure_url` is returned from API
- Check browser console for CORS errors

---

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets:**
   - `.env` is in `.gitignore`
   - Use environment variables in production

2. **Use signed uploads:**
   - Our API signs uploads server-side
   - Prevents unauthorized uploads

3. **Validate uploads:**
   - Check file type
   - Check file size
   - Sanitize filenames

4. **Rate limiting:**
   - Consider adding rate limits to upload endpoint
   - Prevent abuse

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Avatar upload (DONE)
2. ðŸ“‹ Banner upload (16:5 ratio, 5MB limit)
3. ðŸ“‹ Delete avatar/banner functionality
4. ðŸ“‹ Image compression settings
