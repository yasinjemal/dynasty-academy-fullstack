## üêõ DEBUGGING TIPS

### Issue: "Generate Certificate" button not showing

**Check:**

```sql
-- Is course completed?
SELECT progress, status, "completedAt"
FROM course_enrollments
WHERE "userId" = '[YOUR-USER-ID]'
AND "courseId" = '[COURSE-ID]';
```

Should return:

- progress: 100
- status: 'completed'
- completedAt: [timestamp]

**Fix:**

```powershell
node setup-certificate-test.mjs
```

---

### Issue: API returns "Certificates not available"

**Check:**

```sql
-- Are certificates enabled?
SELECT id, title, "certificateEnabled"
FROM courses
WHERE id = '[COURSE-ID]';
```

Should return:

- certificateEnabled: true

**Fix:**

```sql
UPDATE courses
SET "certificateEnabled" = true
WHERE id = '[COURSE-ID]';
```

---

### Issue: PDF doesn't download

**Check browser console:**

- Look for errors in Network tab
- Check `/api/certificates/[code]/download` response
- Should return `application/pdf`

**Check server logs:**

- Look for jsPDF errors
- Check if certificate exists in database

---

### Issue: Verification page shows 404

**Check:**

```sql
-- Does certificate exist?
SELECT * FROM certificates
WHERE "verificationCode" = '[CODE]';
```

Should return certificate record.

**Fix:** Regenerate certificate by clicking "Generate Certificate" again.
